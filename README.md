|   9 | External Data       | - items.json: contains all items <br> - enemies.json: contains all enemies <br> - Paramters are the needed values to create enemy/item i.e. health, type, size etc. <br> - Paramters also contain the sprite to be used to create the enemy/item <br> - For further information look at the design document, there you can find the interfaces <br> - External data was useful for storing all the different kinds of items and enemies and the loading them into the game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   A | Light               | - The regular light is an ambient light, iluminating the floor and the walls <br> - Collecting the item 'cursed lightbulb' turns down the color of the ambient light, making everything look darker <br> - The avatar then has a point light attached to them illuminating only those parts of the floor close to them <br> - Enemies / items etc. are still fully lit so they are easier to spot and the game doesn't become harder than it already is :) <br> - For testing purposes you can put cursed true in you sessionStorage to have the effects of the 'cursed lightbuld' item                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
